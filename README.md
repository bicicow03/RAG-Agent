# RAG-Agent

Desgined to assist in task planning on notion with 2 main functions:
1.Grab general information and content about a specific document
2.Help plan out a task on notion by gathering all current information about the task available in the database and creating a guide on what needs to be done by specific dates to complete the task/project before the due date.

Note: The model is still under progress and being refined and some one the first function may not work correctly yet due issue with the embedder and retriever not always giving the LLMs the correct documents.
